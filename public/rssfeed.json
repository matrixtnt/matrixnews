            "summary": "<p>When Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai steps onto the stage at the company&rsquo;s annual developer conference on Tuesday, which is set to take place at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, he may try to make a case for how Google continues to leverage AI, bringing it to its most popular products that are used by billions of people every day. Pichai would leave no opportunity to drive the message that &ldquo;AI&rdquo; and &ldquo;generative AI&rdquo; are crucial to its developers, consumers, analysts, and investors. Pundits are in agreement that Google needs to impress if it wants to keep its title as the most innovative technology company &ndash; and if it wants to continue to be at the center of the tech ecosystem through Android, the app store, the search engine, and huge developer support.</p>\r\n<p class=\"no_first_intro_para\">Google's I/O, like other developer conferences, is largely focused on the platforms for which app makers and developers build. It&rsquo;s not often aimed directly at consumers, but Google uses its annual developer conference to bring meaningful updates to its core apps, services, and operating systems, spanning Android, Gmail, Chrome, Photos, Workspace, and others that are of consumer interest as well. This year won&rsquo;t be too different, and it&rsquo;s possible Google will announce new software updates at this year&rsquo;s conference, keeping up with the trend of past conferences.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block\"><span class=\"custom-caption\">&nbsp;The event is taking place at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, just down the road from Google&rsquo;s headquarters. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)</span>\r\n<p>Perhaps the biggest announcements at Google I/O will revolve around AI or artificial intelligence, as it has been the focus of the entire tech industry for the past few months. Pichai and Co. will demonstrate how AI powers every product Google currently offers and what&rsquo;s coming in the future. Industry insiders expect Google&rsquo;s deep investments in artificial intelligence to be showcased at its annual developer conference this week.</p>\r\n</div>",
